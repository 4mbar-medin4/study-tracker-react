# Pastel Notes

A beautifully simple, pastel-themed note-taking app with tag filtering, markdown support, and even study session tracking! Built with React, TypeScript, and Bootstrap — and sprinkled with a little extra ✨magic✨.

## Inspired By

This project is based on the amazing [Web Dev Simplified Note-Taking App Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j898RGRw0b4) by Kyle Cook.

## Features

- Create, edit, and delete notes with markdown support
-  Tag your notes and filter by tags
- Track study sessions with start/end timers
- Custom pastel theme (because productivity should be pretty)
- LocalStorage-powered persistence — your notes stay safe!

## Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript
- React Router
- React Bootstrap
- React Markdown
- CSS custom theming

## Styling

We ditched the default Bootstrap blue and went full pastel:
- **Primary Color:** Lavender (#ba68c8)
- **Font:** Quicksand for that friendly, modern vibe

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
